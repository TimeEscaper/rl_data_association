# Joint Compatibility Data Association

Classical algorithm for DA based on the [article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/976019)

## How it works

To get association you need to use the method get_jcbb(observation). It calculates Mahalanobis distance for every possible association hypotheses and return the hypothesis with the smallest Mahalanobis distance

## Parameters

Same as in PS3
